# Wall Tones progress

Personal backlog for what still needs work — not an agent task list. Move items between sections as you go. Mark an item `in progress` when it starts and `done` when it meets the acceptance line in [WALL_TONES_PLAN.md](WALL_TONES_PLAN.md). Add a dated note for anything blocked or deliberately deferred. Times are Asia/Jerusalem.

## Not started

- [ ] Setup window: bigger threshold angle to jump back into view
- [ ] Setup window: after mode is selected, place it a little farther away, a little higher, and make it draggable
- [ ] Bug: first box in the pattern is not blinking in VR (arrow also not showing)
- [ ] Blink should use the cube’s color, not white
- [ ] Allow clicking the button with a ray
- [ ] Sports mode that disables ray button clicks
- [ ] Animation and juice
- [ ] Wrist band that shows the buttons playing the pattern
- [ ] Incremental features (park smaller follow-ups here as they come up)

## In progress

## Done

- [x] Replace the Wall Tones placeholder panel with mode choice, best streak, and round status. Keep `back-to-menu-button`.
- [x] Add `src/wall-tones/` for setup, pad volumes, sequence state, and speech. Register the systems from `src/index.ts`. Run only while the mode is `walltones`.
- [x] Desktop: spawn four pads in a 2 by 2 grid in front of the player, skip scanning, and accept a click as a touch.
- [x] Sequence rules: playback, growing sequence, wrong touch resets the current run to one note, best streak stays, streak clears when returning to the menu.
- [x] English `speechSynthesis` lines, cancelled on exit and when a new line starts.
- [x] Headset: passthrough session with plane detection, anchors, and hand tracking, without changing the VR hub config for demo and meditation.
- [x] Room scale: four 1 m pads on vertical planes, prefer one wall each, share a wall with about a 0.25 m gap when needed. If four will not fit, voice leads into air placement and no partial set is left behind.
- [x] Sitting: four pads on one table plane, or the same air placement when no table qualifies.
- [x] Air placement: four pinch-to-place steps. Pinch does not press a pad during play.
- [x] Hands-only hits: index fingertip enters a thick box once per touch. Controllers do not count.
- [x] Verify desktop play and leave Quest plane, anchor, and fingertip checks noted here if a headset was not available.

## Notes

- **2026-11-03 (Asia/Jerusalem):** Desktop round verified in the managed browser (screenshot + recording). Quest passthrough, plane placement, anchors, and live fingertip hits were not run in this session — no headset attached to the cloud agent. Use the dev tunnel URL on a Quest to validate AR setup.
- **2026-11-03 (Asia/Jerusalem):** Fixed flat/desktop pad placement (camera-relative grid; was spawning under the floor at player origin). Automated flat play reached **best streak 10** via `scripts/wall-tones-streak-10.mjs`.
- **2026-11-03 (Asia/Jerusalem):** Fixed Quest/browser audio (unlock Web Audio on menu + first pad tap) and flat start (pads were ignored until tap-to-start). Moved/shrank HUD and enlarged pad hit boxes so all four grid pads are reachable.
- **2026-11-03 (Asia/Jerusalem):** Quieter voice (streak praise every 5 only); stronger pad tones (pointerdown audio priming + HTML WAV fallback).
- **2026-11-03 (Asia/Jerusalem):** Air placement no longer sticks a solid pad on the face — ghost follows the hand as a hollow outline, stays ≥ ~0.7 m from the eyes, uses smaller sitting pads, and solidifies on pinch.
